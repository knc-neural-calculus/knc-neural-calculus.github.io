PhD Student at UW Madison with a background in computer sciences and applied mathematics. 

Focusing on sim2real reinforcement learning. I have dabbled in neuro-evolution and I am particularly proud of a solution to Atari space-invaders(RAM variant) arrived at through neuro-evolution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFZZjQkz7RA. 

I am interested in any form of learning in which a previously unseen task can be learned without explicit programming.
