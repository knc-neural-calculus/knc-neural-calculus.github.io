- Currently developing a machine learning model for mouse pose tracking to monitor behavioral phenotypes of a novel epilepsy animal model involving loss of function mutations in GABAA receptors in the startle response inhibition pathway.
- Submitted paper in Neuropharmacology characterizing a novel, potent sulfated neurosteroid with unique NMDA inhibition and GABAA potentiation effects which make it a possible next-generation anti-depressant.
- Developed and used a protocol for surface-based morphometry in CAT12 to identify significant structural changes in stroke patients receiving brain-computer interface therapy. Correlated identified changes to motor recovery scores.
- Quantitatively compared voxel-based morphometry MRI analysis methods (SPM12, CAT12, FSL) to identify regional biases within each protocol.
