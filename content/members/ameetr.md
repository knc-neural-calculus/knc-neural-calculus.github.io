I'm broadly interested in using neuroscience to inform deep learning and vice versa. For example, right now, I'm incredibly interested in the interplay between evolution and plasticity and how that could be exploited to design a meta-learning algorithm for spiking neural networks.

Right now, I'm working in a research position in an applied computational role in a neuroscience lab, dealing with pose estimation via deep learning, lots of statistical problems, and spike data analysis. I'm also doing side projects in theoretical deep learning/theoretical neuroscience with Dan Goodman, creating a meta-learning algorithm for spiking neural networks using RNNs as surrogate gradients.
