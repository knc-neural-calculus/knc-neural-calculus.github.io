I'm interested in interdisciplinary ML and computational biology. Specifically, right now I am interested in understanding how the brain learns. I have a math and CS degree and lot of programming experience and enjoy research that focuses on simulation.  I am also proficient in CUDA and OpenGL and have done internships and research using these tools for fast simulation.

Right now, I am working on a paper with doctor Daniel forger at University of Michigan using ML techniques to train biological neural networks. I have also written very fast software in OpenGL and CUDA with Daniel Forger for simulation and visualization of large-scale neural networks although I have yet to turn this work into a paper. In my free time, I have also done a lot of interesting programming projects that are on my github, most notably, I wrote a 3D rigid body physics engine and software for terrain generation using voxel modelling code I wrote in CUDA.
