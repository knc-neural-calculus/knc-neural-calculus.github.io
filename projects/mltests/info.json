	"long_desc": "This is a project with the loose goal of finding interesting ways to generate intelligent agents through trial and error. There are currently distinct Python and C++ architectures, each with a default basic spiking neural network and a experimental frequency-domain based spiking neural network. The documentation on github provides more information."
