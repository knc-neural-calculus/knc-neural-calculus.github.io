	"long_desc": "This project implements a variety of neuron models under a common framework in python. Sympy is used for the model definitions, which makes it very easy to export the models to a LaTeX doc. Tools included allow for spiketrain extraction, generation of frequency-current curves, phase plots (where applicable), bifurcation plots, and other things. "
