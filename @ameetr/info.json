	"proj_blurb": "Right now, I'm working in a research position in an applied computational role in a neuroscience lab, dealing with pose estimation via deep learning, lots of statistical problems, and spike data analysis. I'm also doing side projects in theoretical deep learning/theoretical neuroscience with Dan Goodman, creating a meta-learning algorithm for spiking neural networks using RNNs as surrogate gradients.",
