For example, right now, I'm incredibly interested in the interplay between evolution and plasticity and how that could be exploited to design a meta-learning algorithm for spiking neural networks. </p><h2>Projects:</h2><p>Right now, I'm working in a research position in an applied computational role in a neuroscience lab, dealing with pose estimation via deep learning, lots of statistical problems, and spike data analysis. I'm also doing side projects in theoretical deep learning/theoretical neuroscience with Dan Goodman, creating a meta-learning algorithm for spiking neural networks using RNNs as surrogate gradients.</p>
