    I graduated from the University of Michigan in April 2020 with a math degree and a CS minor. I'm currently taking a gap year to finish and publish some work. I intend to pursue a graduate degree in computational neuroscience in the future. In general, I'm interested in how biological neural networks learn. These days I'm working on novel algorithms for training SNNs, with a soft spot for the HH model ‚ù§. I've recently written a paper with James Hazeden (he should have a page on this site, James if you see this bug me to link you) and Daniel Forger on using SGD to train a layered network of HH neurons. That may or may not appear at a <a href="https://beyondbackprop.github.io/">NeurIPS Workshop</a>. I'll need to update on how that goes. After that I'm hoping to work on something related to training using <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/738385v4.full.pdf">eligibility propogation</a>, neuromodulated STDP, or <a href="https://neurophysics.ucsd.edu/courses/physics_171/annurev.neuro.28.061604.135703.pdf">dendritic morphology</a>. I've also got some work in game theory and combinatorics that has been "almost done" for months now.

    I also have a bunch of random tools and stuff up on my <a href="https://github.com/mivanit">github</a>. I've previously done some work in simulating connectome generation, neuromodulation of networks, neuroevolution, and

    If you're interested in hearing more about any of these, I'm more than happy to rant about them over email.

      <b>U-net CT scan segmentation:</b> 
      built a system for using the U-net architecture to segment bladders and other organs. Tried to teach it to understand topological constraints by injecting stuff into the loss function, with limited success.

      <b>analyzing 4d voxel cell interaction data</b> 
      ...I ended up doing most of it by hand. I tried to automate it to some extent, but this work was done in 2016 and I was not very experienced. Did some statistical analysis of all the data I gathered. I'll be honest, my involvement with the biological side of things was minimal.

In a weird turn of events, that U-net architecture I built ended up being used for a somewhat similar cell-segmentation task by <a href="https://johnmday.com">John M Day</a>.
